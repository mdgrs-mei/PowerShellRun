### Build and Test

Before building the project, you need .NET SDK installed. Follow the steps in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/) and install the latest SDK. After getting the access to the `donet` command, you can build the project by calling the build script:

```powershell
& .\Build.ps1
```

After the build, basic functionalities that are not dependent to the interactive part can be tested using Pester:

```powershell
& .\tests\RunPesterTests.ps1
```

For interactive testing on the console, we recommend that you install [RestartableSession](https://github.com/mdgrs-mei/RestartableSession) module. Once installed, you can set up a testing console by running this script:

```powershell
& .\tests\RestartableSession.ps1
```

This script builds the project and import the built module. When you make a code modification, you can just call `restart` command to do the same process (build and import). The Pester test can be run by `pester` command.

### Coding

When you make a code modification, please follow the style of the existing code. For code formatting, we recommend that you use Visual Studio Code since the formatting settings are included in `.vscode` folder.
